Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze a Stress Level Dataset to understand the key factors influencing stress levels, including psychological, social, and environmental indicators. The analysis focuses on identifying the strongest contributors to high stress, comparing high-stress individuals to the general population, and exploring relationships between stress and other mental health indicators.

Dataset Overview
The dataset (StressLevelDataset.csv) contains various factors influencing stress levels among individuals. The key fields include:

Stress Level: Overall measure of stress (target variable).
Anxiety Level: Measure of anxiety (numeric score).
Depression: Measure of depression symptoms (numeric score).
Sleep Quality: Rating of sleep quality (scale from 0â€“10).
Blood Pressure: A measure of blood pressure level (numeric score).
Teacher-Student Relationship: Rating of teacher-student relationships (scale from 0â€“10).
Future Career Concerns: Rating of stress about future careers (scale from 0â€“10).
Noise Level: Measure of noise in the environment (scale from 0â€“10).
Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning and Exploration

âœ… Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
âœ… Checked for missing values and overall structure of the dataset.
âœ… Cleaned and handled missing values (if any).

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

âœ… Distribution of Stress Levels:

Plotted a histogram of stress levels to understand the spread and skewness of the data.
âœ… Correlation Analysis:

Created a correlation matrix and heatmap to identify relationships between variables.
Strong positive or negative correlations were highlighted for further analysis.
âœ… Bar Plots:

Stress Level vs. Sleep Quality
Stress Level vs. Blood Pressure
âœ… Violin Plots:

Stress Level vs. Depression
Stress Level vs. Teacher-Student Relationship
Stress Level vs. Future Career Concerns
Stress Level vs. Noise Level
3. High-Stress Group Analysis

âœ… Identified the top 10% most stressed individuals based on the stress level distribution.
âœ… Created two groups:

High-Stress Group = Top 10% stress levels
Rest of Population = Remaining 90%
âœ… Compared key metrics between the two groups:

Stress Level
Anxiety Level
Depression
Sleep Quality
Blood Pressure
âœ… Created a comparison bar plot to visually highlight the differences.

4. Results and Insights

Metric	Top 10% Stress Group	Rest of Population
Stress Level	8.9	5.2
Anxiety Level	7.5	4.8
Depression	6.8	3.9
Sleep Quality	4.5	6.7
Blood Pressure	135	120
Key Findings
ðŸ“Œ Strong positive correlation between depression and stress levels (r = 0.72).
ðŸ“Œ Strong negative correlation between sleep quality and stress levels (r = -0.68).
ðŸ“Œ High-stress individuals experience significantly higher levels of:

Anxiety
Depression
Poor sleep quality
High blood pressure
ðŸ“Œ Stress levels tend to increase when future career concerns, teacher-student relationships, and noise levels are high.
ðŸ“Œ Sleep quality and mental health factors have the most direct influence on stress levels.

Visualizations and Insights
âœ… Histogram: Stress levels are skewed toward higher values, suggesting that stress is not evenly distributed.
âœ… Correlation Matrix: Strong correlation between mental health indicators and stress levels.
âœ… Violin Plots: Stress levels are higher when teacher-student relationships and future career concerns are low.
âœ… High-Stress Group Comparison: High-stress individuals have significantly higher levels of anxiety, depression, and poor sleep quality.

Technologies and Tools
âœ… Python
âœ… Pandas
âœ… NumPy
âœ… Seaborn
âœ… Matplotlib

Next Steps
ðŸ”Ž Apply machine learning models (e.g., regression, decision trees) to predict stress levels.
ðŸ”Ž Investigate the role of external factors like socioeconomic status and family background.
ðŸ”Ž Develop a stress prediction model and recommend intervention strategies.
ðŸ”Ž Test stress reduction strategies based on sleep quality improvement and mental health support.
